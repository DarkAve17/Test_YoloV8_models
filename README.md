A simple Script that helps with testing all kinds of YoloV8 models on your local computer

Workflow - 
- Make sure to edit the paths to your model and video inside the script
- run the run.bat file
- it will create a Virtual environment, if it doesnt already exist
- switch to it, install the needed dependencies
- Run your model on the given video and display the detections on screen
- Might need to check the CUDA version to be installed
